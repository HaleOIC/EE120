# Signal-and-Systems

This repository contains all the course related materials for `UCB EE120 : signal and system`

[Course Website :artificial_satellite:](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee120/fa19/)

The course is very interesting, You can learn a lot about `numpy, matplot` operations and more complex concepts in the frequency area.

More details about the labs:

- [x] `Lab1`: An introduction to `ipynb` , its enviroment and `convolve`
- [x] `Lab2`: LTI Filtering
- [x] `Lab3`: the implementation of the `FFT` (which is a faster way for `DFT` ), and a comparasion with the `np.fft.fft`
- [x] `Lab4`: Infer heart rate by analyzing image data of fingers using the knowledge we have learned.
- [x] `Lab5`: let you denoise the photos taken by the Hubble Telescope and restore the gorgeous and clear starry sky
- [ ] `Lab6`: let you build a feedback system that balances a thin rod on a cart

These labs make up a specially crafted curriculum, which can give you a better, deeper undetstanding of the `signal and systems`, which is not just a complex calculation.

However, It contains codes that comes from the HUST formal course, I promise the codes is totally written by my hands line by line, hope you can have a nice day in the HUST.
